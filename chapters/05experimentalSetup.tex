\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{ExperimentalSetup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We aim to answer the following questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RQ1: How do different input types (source, unstripped decompiled, demi-stripped, stripped) affect the model's performance (data-richness effect)?
        \item RQ2: What is the impact of data duplication on the model's performance (data-duplication effect)?
        \item RQ3: To what extent each aspect of stripped decompiled binaries impacts the model's performance (data-input study)?
        \item RQ4: How do different pre-training objectives affect the model's performance (model-objective effect)?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Explain what script was used for deduplication
    \item Explain how the model was loaded in and what configurations were used
    \item Explain which metrics we used to assess the model
    \item Explain the baseline of CodeT5 on normal programming languages, and our own finetuning on source-C
\end{itemize}
